## Sprint 3 Planning Meeting
We had our sprint 3 Planning meeting on the C01 Discord server on October 25th, 2022, with the purpose of choosing which user stories should be included, identifying the associated tasks to the user stories, and dividing the work among the team members. During this meeting, every member of our team was present.

We chose seven user stories at the planning meeting that we thought required for the fundamental functionality of our application. These user stories enable users of our application to edit items, delete events, leave feedback, etc. We next divide the user stories into subtasks, utilize planning poker to evaluate the subtasks, and distribute them along with document responsibilities among our members.

## Sprint Goal:
- Learning MERN Stack and other frameworks/tools
- CSS Styling, making frontend more responsive for Item Page, Events Page, in general.
- In general improvements to the 
- Backend: setting up server, maintaining MVC pattern, routing for Events, Items.
- Frontend: creating Items Page, Edit Item Page, Search feature and other interfaces.
- Hold meetings to coordinate the work better moving forward within team members.

# Spikes

- We had good coordination between the frontend and backend team as some features this Sprint required better coordination but we can improve on holding meetings for team members to discuss how to design a feature and how to implement it in an efficient manner so that future features can be benefited from it. 
- Our team had to learn some frameworks & tools that is incorporated into MERN Stack, our frontend team had to learn React and redux and backend team had to learn Nodejs and Expressjs framework and how models and routing and MongoDB works together.
- Our team ran into some merge conflicts this sprint as well and we as a team had to cooperate with each other and work together to get around it. We understand merge conflicts are part of software development and we just need to know how to work around them cooperatively.
