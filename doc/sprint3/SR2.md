# Sprint 1 Retrospective Meeting

## Participants In Meeting
- Nandhakishore Krishnamurthy Shanthi
- John Yuan
- Shence Yang
- Muntaqa Mahmood
- Henry Zhuo
- Shun Murai
- Andrew Qian

## Unfinished Tasks
- [TA-49] Fix the styling and improve on css for multiple pages especially Home and Events.
> "TA-49 was planned to fix the image display format in event/item landing page, but this week is too busy for CS students (midterms and assignments due)
so we delay the ticket to next sprint"

## Practies To Continue Using
- Productive standups to know what everyone is doing and split the work
- Help each other when needed
- Reschedule the work after we face some difficulties (time budget).
- Conducting a meeting before the final submission of each sprint to check the file together
 
## New Practices To Use
- work in a group of two or three to finish the high-difficulty task.
- Merge the Pull Request as they are created, review carefully

## Harmful Practices To Stop Using
- Documenting the project at the end of the sprint
- make sure next time there's no one doing the duplicate works.

## Best Experiences
- Everyone contribute a lot in the sprint, standup meeting goes well 
- Learn and improve our programming skill (both front-end and back-end)

## Worst Experiences
- Debugging and remove the duplicate part of codes.
- Don't have enough time to work on the feature this week, the workload for other courses are especially stressful this week.
