## Participants In Meeting
- Nandhakishore Krishnamurthy Shanthi
- John Yuan
- Shence Yang
- Muntaqa Mahmood
- Henry Zhuo
- Shun Murai
- Andrew Qian

## Unfinished Tasks
- None


## Practies To Continue Using
- Standups going well, we report what we did in every standup and schedule what to do next.
- Help each other when needed or finish task earlier
- discuss together and came out with special cases for testing
- Conducting a meeting before the final submission of each sprint to check the file together
 
## New Practices To Use
- divide the whole team into two groups to work on the difficult user stories (high story point)
- Merge the Pull Request as they are created, review carefully

## Harmful Practices To Stop Using
- Documenting the project at the end of the sprint
- make sure to start early, so that we dont have to hurry at last several days

## Best Experiences
- Everyone contribute in the sprint, standup meeting goes well 
- work as a group of four so we could get more helps from each other and after one team finished earlier, they help another team.

## Worst Experiences
- Debugging front-end / back-end code
- some of the user storries are too hard for us to do in a short time, need more time to learn.
