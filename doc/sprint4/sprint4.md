## Sprint 4 Planning Meeting
We had our sprint 4 Planning meeting on the C01 Discord server on November 14th, 2022, with the purpose of choosing which user stories should be included, identifying the associated tasks to the user stories, and dividing the work among the team members. During this meeting, every member of our team was present.

We chose the rest eight user stories at the planning meeting that were left in the Product Backlog, all the basic, satisfier and some delghter functionalities of our application. These user stories enable users of our application to add items to cart, place orders from their Cart page and review orders placed in an email they get from us(UTSCHub team). Some improvements to frontend, code refactoring, etc have been the focus of this sprint as we plan to deliver our application at the end of this sprint. We next divide the user stories into subtasks, utilize planning poker to evaluate the subtasks, and distribute them along with document responsibilities among our members.

# Spikes
- We had good coordination between the frontend and backend team as some features this Sprint required better coordination like the chat system and Cart and View all my Orders features required some research and discussion on the logic and implementation. 
- Our team had to learn some libraries & tools that is incorporated into MERN Stack for the chat system.
- Most of our team members had midterms and other commitments this sprint but we as a team found ways to make things work and finish our work.
