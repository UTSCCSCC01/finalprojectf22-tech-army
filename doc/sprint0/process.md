### How did you organize the team? 
The UTSC Hub team was organized and formed with friends and acquaintances met in lecture.

### Which tools did you use, if any? 
Discord is our primary tool of communication. 

### How did you make decisions?
We firstly discuss and list out all the options and opinions from each member and then we either vote or talk about the pros and cons of some features and come to a general consensus. Since there are 7 of us, in case of any voting, 4 votes would be needed to go through with a particular point. 


### How did you define priority and/or points of user stories?
We discuss the difficulty and pros and cons of the user stories and finally come to a vote.

### How many rounds of voting (on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?
Approximately one round of voting seems to be enough
 
### How frequently did you meet? 
We are planning to meet 3 to 4 times a week on discord. The dates set are Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday.

### What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?

- Having shorter meetings and clearly distribute the work during that time. Try to finish the work before 5pm of Friday.
