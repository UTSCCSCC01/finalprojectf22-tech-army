# How is your product different?

Existing products (e.g Ebay) have too many unrelated items and does not have enough UTSC exclusive items (e.g UTSC merch, textbooks), our app will solve this problem because our product is exclusively for UTSC students, meaning that you can only buy and sell things relevant to UTSC students.

It is an e-commerce app but can also be used as a social media app, for e.g you do basic things like message other people and create your posts, you can network with other UTSC students with similar interests, plans for renting rooms, find and connect with people that are taking the same classes as you, (potentially) rate courses and professors?, (potentially) built-in group chats for courses?

## If your product is better for specific users and/or specific scenarios, Who are the users and/or what are the scenarios? 
   - Users: University of Toronto Scarborough students
   - Scenario 1: Freshmen UTSC students looking for roommates to move in with on res or in apartments/houses nearby campus through the SMS feature.
   - Scenario 2: UTSC students looking to buy or sell things not restricted to textbooks or other course materials
   - Scenario 3: UTSC students who want to invite other students to a specific event or join an event hold by other UTSC students.
   - Scenario 4: UTSC student who wants to gather people for a pick up soccer game in UTSC valley.

# Why do you think the competitors didnâ€™t focus on these users and/or scenarios? And, what would it take from them to do so?
The competitors didn't focus on these users because the number of UTSC students is too small to focus on, it would take a very large expansion of class size for them to focus on UTSC.
