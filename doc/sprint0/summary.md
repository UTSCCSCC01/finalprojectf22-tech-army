## The Project Objective: 
Our project is creating a website that targets all UTSC students and faculty members to distribute further convenience within the community and explore the embedded demands and supplies by offering a UTSC specific ECommerce platform. Besides that, our website also aims to accomplish more sophisticated community engagement with our distinctive SNS and event planning features. <br> 

## Key Users:
UTSC students who  want to purchase university merchandise and old textbooks <br>
UTSC students who want to gather people to play a particular sport <br>
UTSC students who want to join other people to play a particular sport <br>
UTSC students and faculty who want to connect with fellow UTSC students and get more information regarding the university <br>

## Key Use Cases:
Our website could further be broken down into three sub parts: Market place, Event Management, and SNS features. Market Place feature lets users sell and buy second-handed resources and commodities (C to C model). Event management feature lets users plan and attend events of their choice and promote campus inclusivity. SNS feature lets user chat with one another and post content regarding the university.

## Key Usage Scenarios:
 Our target usersâ€™ primary key usage scenarios could possibly be 3rd and 4th year students who would graduate soon and would like to sell thier belongings that are no longer necessary (textbooks, study-related commodities, etc.). The faculty members who would want to advertise a certain on campus event would be one of our primary target users as well. Atheletic students who want to organise a pick up game in pan am or the UTSC valley can use the app to either host a game or join a game.
